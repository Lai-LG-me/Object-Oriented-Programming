# Bank Account Types and Implementation

## Account Types
### Savings Account
- Earns interest that compounds monthly.
- The interest is calculated based on the balance on the last day of the month.

### Current Account
- No interest is earned.
- Customers are given a small number of free transactions per month.
- A nominal transaction fee is charged for each additional transaction beyond the free limit.

## Class Structure
### Superclass: `Account`
- **Properties:**
  - `accountNumber`: Unique identifier for the account.
  - `balance`: Current balance in the account.
  - `dateCreated`: Date when the account was created.
- **Methods:**
  - `deposit(amount)`: Adds the specified amount to the account balance.
  - `withdraw(amount)`: Deducts the specified amount from the account balance, if sufficient funds are available.

### Subclasses
#### SavingsAccount
- **Additional Methods:**
  - `calculateInterest()`: Calculates the interest amount based on the current balance.
  - `addInterest()`: Adds the calculated interest to the balance.

#### CurrentAccount
- **Additional Properties:**
  - `freeTransactions`: Number of free transactions per month.
  - `transactionFee`: Fee for transactions beyond the free limit.
- **Modified Method:**
  - `withdraw(amount)`: Deducts the transaction fee from the balance if the number of free transactions is exceeded.

## Test Program
Write a program to test the functionality of the `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` classes:
1. Create objects of both account types.
2. Test the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods to ensure correct functionality.
3. For `SavingsAccount`:
   - Test the methods for calculating interest and adding it to the balance.

## Client Program
Design a menu-driven program to handle transactions for a current account:
- **Menu Options:**
  1. Deposit funds into the account.
  2. Withdraw funds from the account.
  3. Check the account balance.
  4. Exit the program.
- Ensure transaction fees are deducted from the account balance when the number of free transactions is exceeded.
