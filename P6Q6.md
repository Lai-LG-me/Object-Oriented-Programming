## Problem Statement

A bank offers its customers the following account types:
- **Savings Account**: Earns interest that compounds monthly, i.e., the interest is calculated based on the balance on the last day of the month.
- **Current Account**: No interest is earned, but the customer is given a small number of free transactions per month and is charged a nominal transaction fee for each additional transaction.


### Implementation Details

1. **Superclass: Account**
   - **Properties**:
     - `accountNumber`: Represents the unique identification number of the account.
     - `balance`: Holds the current account balance.
     - `dateCreated`: Indicates when the account was created.
   - **Methods**:
     - `deposit(amount)`: Allows deposits into the account balance.
     - `withdraw(amount)`: Enables withdrawals from the account balance.

2. **Subclass: SavingsAccount**
   - **Additional Methods**:
     - `calculateInterest()`: Calculates the monthly interest based on the current account balance.
     - `addInterest()`: Adds the calculated interest to the account balance.

3. **Subclass: CurrentAccount**
   - **Additional Properties**:
     - `freeTransactions`: Specifies the number of free transactions permitted each month.
     - `transactionFee`: Indicates the fee charged for transactions exceeding the free limit.
   - **Modified Method**:
     - `withdraw(amount)`: Ensures that transaction fees are deducted for transactions exceeding the free limit.

### Testing Program

- Write a program to:
  1. Create objects for `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount`.
  2. Test the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods to ensure accurate functionality.
  3. Include statements in `SavingsAccount` to test the calculation and addition of interest to the balance.

### Client Program

- Design a simple menu-driven program to handle transactions for a current account:
  - **Menu Options**:
    1. Deposit funds into the account.
    2. Withdraw funds from the account.
    3. Check the account balance.
    4. Exit the program.
  - Deduct transaction fees if the number of free transactions has been exceeded.
