A bank offers its customers the following account types:
● The savings account earns interest that compounds monthly i.e. the interest is calculated
based on the balance on the last day of the month.
● The current account has no interest, but the customer is given a small number of free
transactions per month and is charged a nominal transaction fee for each additional
transaction.
Create a superclass Account that has the properties account number, balance, and date
created, and methods for deposit and withdrawal. Create two subclasses for savings and current
accounts. The class for savings account should have methods to calculate the interest amount
and to add the interest to the balance.

(b) Write a test program that creates objects of SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount.
Test the deposit and withdraw methods in each class to ensure that they work correctly. For
the SavingsAccount class, include statements to test the methods for calculating the interest
amount and adding the interest to the balance.

(c) Write a client program that has a simple menu for handling transactions for a current account.
Your program should ensure that the transaction fee is deducted from the account balance if the
number of free transactions has been exceeded for the month.
